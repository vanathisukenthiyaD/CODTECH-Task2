Overview Of The Project

Project Description
            The Weather App displays real-time weather information for a specific location. It has a simple and visually appealing user interface designed using HTML for structure and 
            CSS for styling. While HTML and CSS are used for the static structure and design, JavaScript (optional for interactivity) is used for fetching weather data from an API.

Key Features

Users can search for the weather in a specific city or location.
Weather Display:

Shows details such as:
Current temperature
Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy)
Humidity and wind speed
Weather icons
Responsive Design:

Optimized for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Minimal and Clean UI:

Designed with simplicity in mind for easy navigation.

Technologies Used 

    HTML
    Structure:
    Create elements like:
    Input field for the city name
    Buttons for submission

Project Workflow
Setup the Structure:

Build the skeleton of the app with HTML.
  Create containers for weather information.
Design the Interface:

Use CSS for styling:

Colors and fonts for a weather-themed look.
Box shadows and rounded corners for a modern design.
(Optional) Add Interactivity:

Use JavaScript to fetch data from an API (like OpenWeatherMap) and update the DOM dynamically.
Test Responsiveness:

Use media queries to ensure compatibility with different screen sizes.

Enhancements

Animations:
     Use CSS transitions for hover effects or dynamic content.

Icons:
   Include weather icons using a library like FontAwesome or an API.

Background Changes:
     Change the app's background based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).

Output Example
      After completing the project, the app should look like a neat card or widget where users can input a city name and view real-time weather data in an aesthetically pleasing layout.
